# Snake Game

This snake game was created by me when I was just getting started with python. The goal of the game is simple, get the snake food and make him happy. But it's happiness comes at a cost, the more you feed him the bigger it will get and the harder it will be to control him as eating themselves is not actually a viable option. Hence your task is to avoid the walls and the snake's body itself while making him happy. The happiness rating has been displayed above in the score bar. Oh and one more thing the game gets faster as your happiness rating increases as we don't have unlimited pixels to serve up the snake. 

#### The libraries
* **Time** : This library is just used to make the code pause when needed.
* **Random** : Well since we can't spawn the food at the same location everytime random library takes care of that.
* [**Turtle**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) : All of the graphic elements that you see on the screen has been rendered by this turtle library.

### Controls
The game controls are classic "WASD" to move up,left,down,right respectively.
